  <H3 style="color: black; font-size: 20px;"> Making X granary</H3>

main objective of this designe was to make the sliders ourself as comonly used Linear rails couldint be used as our machine is bit large raies are expensive and hard to find localy in our area and the second one was to make the parts millable as 3D printing consumes much more time. bigining with how to hold the frame we started by measuring the size of the extrution and concidered making a 700x700mm bed size. 

<img class="zoomD" src="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/joshwin-johnson/images/Machine/1.jpg" alt="schem.jpg.jpg" style="width:100%;">

slight change was made and the bottom plate was removed as we needed the frame to be held at a hight and the design for the frame was completed

<img class="zoomD" src="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/joshwin-johnson/images/Machine/2.jpg" alt="schem.jpg.jpg" style="width:100%;">

for the x axis my idea was to hold a extrution to move on x asis moving on bearings 4 bearings used on first plate to have smooth motion on one side and 3 on the other plate the design was created 
<img class="zoomD" src="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/joshwin-johnson/images/Machine/3.jpg" alt="schem.jpg.jpg" style="width:100%;">
but realising that the design mght not work as we thought due to the uneven dimention of the extrution and as the z ganery want to suport a bit of a weight our instructer <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablabkochi/students/jogin-francis/">Jogin Fransis</a> suggested to give 2 channels over y azis insted of 1 and asked me to refer our senior batches <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2021/labs/kochi/machine/index.html">project</a> wich had a simple flecture mechanism to overcome the problem with the uneven surface so I adapted their tested sucessful flecture mechanism on to ours.we also changed the holding mechanism to 3D printable design as it has a better holding capablity than the former design.
<img class="zoomD" src="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/joshwin-johnson/images/Machine/4.jpg" alt="schem.jpg.jpg" style="width:100%;">
so now it was time to test the slider for x ganary me and <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/arun-bobby/">Arun</a> with <a href="http://fabacademy.org/2018/labs/fablabkochi/students/jogin-francis/">Jogins</a>  assistence milled Polypropylene plastic(PP) in Zund

then the milled out parts were assembled and tested with <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/arun-bobby/">Aruns</a> help and the part was working fine and we called it a day.

we measured dimention of the belt and made a mechanism to drive the axis using the belt for which the belt was firmly held between 2 bearings and the channel by giving a clearence between the channel and bearing
<img class="zoomD" src="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/joshwin-johnson/images/Machine/5.jpg" alt="schem.jpg.jpg" style="width:80%;">
which while testing was failed as the belt was slipping away from the bearing while the motor was running.

    </video>

so we disided to create a small washer around the bearing which will keep intact the the belt.
<img class="zoomD" src="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/joshwin-johnson/images/Machine/6.jpg" alt="schem.jpg.jpg" style="width:80%;">
 the part was 3D printed and tested.

    </video>

now all parts were perfect to finalise the design for the x asis.

<H3 style="color: black; font-size: 20px;"> Making Y & Z axises</H3>
This part was actually quite easier because we had tested and confirmed the designe aspects so used the same mechanism used in x asis and for z asis we desided to use leadscrew mechanism started with y slider. 8 bearings fro holding on the 2 channels and 6 for the othe pices. 
<img class="zoomD" src="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/joshwin-johnson/images/Machine/7.jpg" alt="schem.jpg.jpg" style="width:100%;">
now for Z axis a lead nut was installed inside the top plate for actuating the z axis motion and a total of 10 bearing was used to make clear sliding motion to the z axis
<img class="zoomD" src="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/joshwin-johnson/images/Machine/8.jpg" alt="schem.jpg.jpg" style="width:100%;">
and a structure for holding the steper was made and fixed on the top of the z axis channel 
<img class="zoomD" src="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/joshwin-johnson/images/Machine/9.jpg" alt="schem.jpg.jpg" style="width:60%;"> the A and B axises were designed by <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/kochi/students/arun-bobby/">Arun Boby</a> and compined with my part to complete the whole design.

Now the design is ready to be milled

finally all part were milled out and we assembled the mechanical structure together and finally the mechanical structure was handed over to electronics amd programming.
